📝 Assignment 1: Fundamentals of Software Testing
✅ 1. Introduction
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it functions as expected and meets user requirements. It is a critical part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it helps detect and fix bugs before the software is released to users.


🧪 2. Key Concepts
Error: A human mistake in design, logic, or coding.

Defect (Bug): A flaw in the software that is caused by an error.

Failure: When the software behaves incorrectly or crashes due to a defect.

📝 Example: If a developer writes incorrect logic, it introduces an error. This error causes a defect in the code, which might lead to a failure when users interact with the software.


🔍 3. Software Testing Principles
Early Testing
Testing should begin as early as possible in the SDLC to reduce cost and effort.

Pesticide Paradox
Repeating the same test cases won’t uncover new defects. Tests must be regularly reviewed and updated.

Defect Clustering
Most defects are usually found in a small number of modules. Focused testing on these areas can be more effective.

⚙️ 4. Static vs. Dynamic Testing
Static Testing:
Performed without executing the code. Examples include code reviews and walkthroughs.

Dynamic Testing:
Involves running the software and verifying its behavior. Examples include unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
🕒 5. Importance of Early Testing in SDLC
Early testing helps identify defects during the design or requirement phase, which saves time and reduces the cost of fixing issues later. Detecting bugs earlier improves the overall software quality and speeds up delivery.
🌟 Bonus: Real-World Example
When building a login system, static testing might catch a missing password validation rule during a code review. Dynamic testing could then simulate user input to check how the system handles invalid logins.
